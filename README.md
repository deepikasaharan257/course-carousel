To set up this project,
First we need to install node.js and npm.

After that we need to create project 'npm -g create-react-app'
then 'npm create-react-app course-carousel'

this will create our empty app. 
we can start it with 'npm start'

then I have used some components which are listed in package.json.
For saving data, I have built database in sql server. we need that to be installed . I have used WEb API for backend and used Entity framework following database first approach.


To run the app in dev environment, First we need to run the https://github.com/deepikasaharan257/carousel-project/blob/master/CollegeWebApp.sln this will start our server

for running the react app, we can first clone the repository course-carousel 
and for running in dev environment,we can open the folder in vs code and in terminal start using npm start

This will launch the app. 

Then we can add, update, delete and get the courses from database.
