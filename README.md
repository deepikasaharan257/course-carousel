To set up this project,
First we need to install node.js and npm.

After that we need to create project 'npm -g create-react-app'
then 'npm create-react-app course-carousel'

this will create our empty app. 
we can start it with 'npm start'

then I have used some components which are listed in package.json.
For saving data, I have built database in sql server. we need that to be installed . I have used WEb API for backend and used Entity framework following database first approach.
